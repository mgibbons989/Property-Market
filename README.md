# Property Market Using React

This is our final project for Web Programming, where we were tasked with creating a startup idea site for a company that aims to connnect property buyers
and sellers on a single platform. We decided to use React, Vite, and Express.js/node.js for this project.

This site comes with login, registration, and properties storage within a database. 

<!--This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh -->
